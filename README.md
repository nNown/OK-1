# Ant Colony Optimization

Ant Colony Optimization is metaheuristic for finding good paths through graphs. This program is solving problem of finding path through all vertices in disconnected graph which contains two isolated subgraphs. Every 10 steps there is a jump to the second graph. Every vertex has generated coordinates on cartesian plane and weight of every edge is equal to distance between them. Cost of jump is equal to distance between vertices as well.
